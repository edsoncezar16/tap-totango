        Record number (0 states "start at record 0"). 

        The record size can be defined using the count parameter (and limited to 1000). 

        Tip: To page through results, ask for 1000 records (count: 1000). If you receive 1000 records, assume there’s more, in which case you want to pull the next 1000 records (offset: 1000…then 2000…etc.). Repeat paging until the number of records returned is less than 1000.
